## Business Problem
Streaming platforms like Netflix constantly invest in new content to retain subscribers, expand in regional markets, and stay ahead of competitors. But without clear visibility into where content investment is declining or underperforming, the company risks losing engagement in key markets. This project helps answer this questions:

- Are we releasing enough content to sustain viewer interest across different countries ?
- Is our content mix (movies vs. TV shows) aligned with audience preferences ?
- Where should we reinvest to maintain market share and reduce churn ?

## Obectives
- Analyze trends in content releases over time (globally and regionally).
- Compare the volume and ratio of TV Shows vs. Movies.
- Identify shifts in content strategy in key markets (e.g. India).
- Generate actionable recommendations for content investment.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Data Description
- **Source**: Kaggle [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)
- **Rows**: 8088
- **Key Columns**:
  - type – Movie or TV Show
  - country – Country of availability
  - date_added – When it was added to the platform
  -  listed_in - Genre 
  - release_year, duration, description

## Tools & Skills Used
- SQL
- Python
- Power BI
- Business analysis

## Approach
- Data Cleaning: Standardized date formats, handled nulls, filtered relevant time range.
- Exploratory Analysis: Used SQL Queries to analyse the data.
- Visual Analysis: Used Power Bi to Create dashboards for content mix, release trends, country growth

## Key Insights
- In India saw a **27% decline** in average monthly content releases (2017–2020).
- **70%** of Netflix’s new content over the past five years has been **Movies**, while just **30%** were **TV shows**.
-  Netflix's catalog has grown over the past **5** years, as evidenced by the addition of **2563** new content items.
-  Only **3.5%** of Netflix content contained words like ‘kill’ or ‘violence’ and was flagged as ‘Bad’, while over 96% of the content was classified as ‘Good’.
  
## Business Recommendations
1. Reignite Growth in High-Potential Regional Markets
  - India’s 27% drop in content releases signals fading investment in a key market. Netflix should double down on regional content production—especially in local languages—to maintain engagement and defend market share.

2. Shift Portfolio Strategy Toward Binge-Worthy TV
  - With 70% of new content being movies, Netflix may be under-serving long-form engagement. Increasing investment in serialized, episodic content could improve viewer retention and session duration.

3. Operationalize Regional Insights with Real-Time Dashboards
  - Equip regional teams with dynamic dashboards to monitor release trends, engagement, and genre performance—enabling faster, data-backed content planning at the country level.

4. Enhance Personalization Using Content Sentiment Signals
  - Only 3.5% of content shows negative tone markers (e.g., “kill”, “violence”). Leverage this insight to improve Netflix’s recommendation system for family-friendly and mood-based viewer segments.
